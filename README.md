# YOLO-NDVI-Yield
YOLO-NDVI-Yield combines YOLOv8 for crop disease detection and Random Forest for yield prediction using NDVI from Sentinel-2 images. It calculates farming costs, estimates yield loss, and visualizes diseased areas. Future enhancements include real-time drone integration and decentralized NDVI storage.
